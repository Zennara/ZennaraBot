Ideas to implement into Zennara:

1. Coordinates List w/ Input
2. In-code/console discord server chat
3. Connect to mc server and send messages to chat (/near bot)
4. Operation Pathfinder
5. moderation commands (mute, ban, kick, etc.)
6. Update code to discord.py 1.x (ds.py rewrite)
7. Make it work for any server (custom commands etc.)
8. Make block message command show # of times blocked/ person
